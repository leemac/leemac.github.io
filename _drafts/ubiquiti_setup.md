My last home was around 1,200 square feet, not too large, but not exactly as small as my prior apartments. It was a quarter acre, which also was just the right size (who wants to mow more lawn?!). The wifi setup was simple, a single Verizon Fios router. It worked well, we had fios+gigabit which was awesome, but the house had dead spots and my Google Fi bill was often higher than usual as it would drop the wifi connection. I needed something better, MUCH better.

Fast forward to the new house I purchase 2 weeks ago. A beautiful home, much larger at 2,400 square feet with a big 1 acre yard.
