I recently moved into a new home, a much larger home and needed to solve my wifi deadspot problem. My last home was around 1,200 square feet, not too large, but not exactly as small as my prior apartments in Boston. The wifi setup was simple, a single Verizon Fios router. It worked well, we had fios + gigabit which was awesome, but the house had dead spots and my Google Fi bill was often higher than usual as it would drop the wifi connection. I needed something better, MUCH better.

Fast forward to my new house. A beautiful home, with Fios/gigabit availability, which is much larger at 2,400 square feet with a big 1 acre yard. There's also a full unfinished basement and attic which I access periodically (the basement is essentially a large workshop). The dead spots were going to be worse and I decided to look into alternatives. I looked around and eventually landed on Ubiquiti. I wanted something that was simple to operate, yet almost enterprise-class. I wanted it to work and not require hacks and constant maintenance. I wanted VPN, VLANs and a very simple UI accessible via the cloud.
