title: Deployment at Facebook/Twitter
---

Iâ€™ve been fascinated recently with some of the cool engineering feats that large companies such as Twitter and Facebook have accomplished. If you think about it, these companies have to replicate petabytes of data, deploy to thousands of servers and keep everything going smoothly without interruption.

I would highly suggest checking out the following articles and videos even if you do not work with the technologies at hand or have the scaling needs for your applications.
