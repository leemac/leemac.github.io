title: Moved to Linode!
---

Last August I realized I needed more control over my hosting environment. I needed root access, the ability to install Python/Ruby and needed more flexibility.

I looked around and found that [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=e00ba6f9f2579bf9e3300b0bc58529096b69765b/) had the best reviews for their support and overall speed. Their plans are pretty well priced as I'm currently paying only $20/mo for my own VPS running Ubuntu. I login via SSH and do all the work to the server via ther terminal which is great as I don't use the terminal day-to-day, it's a great learning tool.

The server is currently hosting this site as well as a few others. I accomplish this by running [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) with a pretty basic configuration.

They're also pretty good at doubling everyone's plans every year or so. Just yesterday I moved the site over to their new hardware: SSD's, double RAM, more CPU Power. Not bad!

Hopefully I'll be updating the site with a little project I'm working on very soon. I haven't started yet, but working on planning it all in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
