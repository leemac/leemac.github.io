A few days back, a user on [Hacker News posted an interesting video of himself developing a Rails app](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3908014) for the Ipad. Sure some might find it boring to watch (it is over an hour long) but the part that intrigues me is you can get insight into how another programmer’s mind works. You get a front row seat and the viewing is both uninterrupted and unedited. Since I’m learning Rails, it’s a great insight to the workflow and different ways of working with the files. Although ‘hackingmichiels’ uses [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) in OS 10.xx and I’m using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), the rest of the development is somewhat the same.

One of the comments in the post brought up procrastination. By recording your development, you are less likely going to browse websites and go off track. Just knowing that someone is watching is enough to keep your subconscious from opening another tab and typing "reddit.com". Perhaps in the future I'll record my self developing an app, sounds like fun!
