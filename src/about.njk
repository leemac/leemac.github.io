            <p>
                Hi there! I'm Lee McKinnon, a software developer and technical leader with over 20 years 
                of experience building products and leading teams. I'm passionate about creating elegant 
                solutions to complex problems and helping others grow in their technical careers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, I work as a technical leader where I focus on architecture, mentoring, and 
                building high-performing engineering teams. I've worked across various technologies and 
                industries, from startups to enterprise organizations.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lead engineering teams and drive technical strategy</li>
                <li>Design and implement scalable software architectures</li>
                <li>Mentor developers and help build technical career paths</li>
                <li>Write about technology, leadership, and software development</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding or leading teams, I'm a devoted father enjoying the adventure of 
                raising children in our digital age. I believe in the importance of work-life balance 
                and often write about the challenges and joys of being both a technical leader and a 
                present parent.
            </p>

            <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
            <p>
                I love connecting with other developers, technical leaders, and anyone interested in 
                the intersection of technology and life. Feel free to reach out!
            </p>
