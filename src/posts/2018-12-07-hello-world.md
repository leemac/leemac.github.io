Hey folks. New blog up and running. This is probably my tenth iteration of a blog, but I hope to share quite a few findings going forward.

The goal of this is to share insights, findings and cool stuff as I explore Azure, C#, Visual Studio, React, TypeScript, leadership etc. Having been a developer for the last 10+ years, I've gained a few tricks to help myself navigate the waters of enterprise development. My role has changed quite a bit, from intern, to junior dev, to more of a senior dev and finally to VP of engineering.

## What's Coming Next

I plan to write about:

- **Technical Leadership**: Lessons learned leading engineering teams
- **Modern Development**: Deep dives into new technologies and frameworks  
- **Work-Life Balance**: The challenge of being a technical leader and present parent
- **Architecture & Design**: Building scalable systems that actually work

## Why Now?

After years of consuming content from others, it's time to give back to the community that has taught me so much. Whether you're just starting out or have been in the industry for years, I hope you'll find something useful here.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you'll stick around for the journey.

See you soon...
