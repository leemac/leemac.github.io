Welcome to my little corner of the internet! üëã

After years of thinking "I should start a blog" and countless conversations with friends about tech, parenting, and life in general, I've finally taken the plunge. This is my first real post, and honestly, it feels both exciting and terrifying to put my thoughts out into the world.

## Why Now?

As an engineer, I spend most of my day solving problems, learning new technologies, and figuring out how to make things work better. But so much of that knowledge just stays trapped in my head or scattered across Slack messages and code comments. I realized I was missing out on:

- **Helping others**: The solutions I discover might help someone else facing the same challenges
- **Learning through teaching**: Writing forces you to really understand what you're talking about
- **Building connections**: The best conversations happen when ideas are shared openly
- **Documenting my journey**: Both the successes and the spectacular failures

## What You Can Expect

This won't be another generic tech blog. I'm planning to write about:

**üîß Engineering & Code**
- Real-world solutions to problems I encounter
- Lessons learned from building products and managing teams
- Thoughts on software architecture, testing, and development practices

**üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Balancing Work and Family**
- How being a dad has changed my perspective on time management and priorities
- The unique challenges (and joys) of working in tech while raising kids
- Finding time for side projects and continuous learning

**üõ†Ô∏è Tinkering and Projects**
- Home automation experiments that actually work (and some that don't)
- Weekend coding projects and what I learned from them
- Reviews of tools and gadgets that make life better

**üí≠ Random Thoughts**
- Book recommendations and what I'm currently reading
- Observations about the tech industry and where it's heading
- Anything else that seems worth sharing

## The Format

I'm not committing to a rigid posting schedule. Life is unpredictable, especially with kids, and I'd rather write quality posts when I have something meaningful to share than force out content just to hit arbitrary deadlines.

Some posts might be quick tips or observations, others might be deep dives into complex topics. I'll let the content dictate the format.

## Join the Conversation

I'm genuinely excited to hear from readers. If you find something useful, disagree with something I've written, or have questions about a topic, please reach out. The best part of blogging is the community that forms around shared interests and experiences.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leemckinnon) or just reply to any post here.

## What's Next?

I already have a few posts in the pipeline:
- A deep dive into the tech stack I chose for this blog (spoiler: Eleventy + TailwindCSS)
- Lessons learned from migrating a legacy Rails app to a modern stack
- My current home office setup and how it's evolved over the years

Thanks for reading this first post, and welcome to the journey! I'm looking forward to sharing more thoughts, stories, and discoveries with you.
