Hey folks. New blog up and running. This is probably my tenth iteration of a blog, but I hope to share quite a few findings going forward.

The goal of this is to share insights, findings and cool stuff as I explore Azure, C#, Visual Studio, React, TypeScript, leadership etc. Having been a developer for the last 10 years or so, I've gained a few tricks to help myself navigate the waters of enterprise development. My role has changed quite a bit, from intern, to junior dev, to more of a senior dev and finally to VP of engineering.

See you soon...
