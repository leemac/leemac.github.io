Hey there, I'm Lee McKinnon and I live in the Greater Boston Area.I <a href="http://wit.edu" target="_blank">went to school in Boston</a>Â for Computer Engineering and I'm currently a <a href="http://ledgex.com" target="_blank">software engineer in the financial industry</a> where I develop enterprise applications on the .NET stack both client and server side.

<p>I work at a <a href="http://ledgex.com/">Ledgex</a> which is an up and coming financial startup where we produce software for fund of hedge funds, endowements, family offices and various institutions. I'm currently Director of Software Engineering where I lead our development efforts while still getting my hands on the code every day.</p>

## Development

From a development standpoint, I professionally work with ASP.NET, WPF, C#, MS-SQL, lots of JavaScript and a good range of open source projects. On the side I like to use Linux (Ubuntu) to develop apps in Python (Django). Hosting is through Linode on my own self-managed VPS.

## Projects

I always have one or two hobby projects that I work on to learn more. Most aren't public and I tend to abandon them after some time due to lack of interest but it's lots of fun working on them and I learn quite a bit.

My current projects are:

- **[LifeCompile](http://lifecompile.com/)** - A site to compile everything about you. (A diary on steroids)
- **[Gardenrr](http://gardenrr.com/)** - A helpful gardening app for Android.

Past projects are:

- **TinyCore** - A tiny blogging platform. PHP/MYSQL
- **WifiMapper** - A school project that mapped wifi access points using a physical GPS/USB dongle as you walked around a city such as Boston (my college town). WPF/XAML/MS-SQL
- **JellyfishRSS** - A replacement for Google Reader when it was taken down. Django/Python
- **PhlixManager** - A Windows desktop application that manages your videos. Was built to help manage home videos on VHS. WPF/XAML/MS-SQL
- **RocketLaunches.org - A site that aggregated all rocket launches. Django/Python/Postgres

## The Site

The site is generated using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
