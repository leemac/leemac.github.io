<p>
Hey there, I'm Lee McKinnon and I live in the Greater Boston Area.I <a href="http://wit.edu" target="_blank">went to school in Boston</a>Â for Computer Engineering and I'm currently a <a href="http://ledgex.com" target="_blank">software engineer in the financial industry</a> where I develop enterprise applications on the .NET stack both client and server side.
</p>

<p>I work at a <a href="http://ledgex.com/">Ledgex</a> which is an up and coming financial startup where we produce software for fund of hedge funds, endowements, family offices and various institutions. I'm currently Director of Software Engineering where I lead our development efforts while still getting my hands on the code every day.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>From a development standpoint, I professionally work with ASP.NET, WPF, C#, MS-SQL, lots of JavaScript and a good range of open source projects. On the side I like to use Linux (Ubuntu) to develop apps in Python (Django). Hosting is through Linode on my own self-managed VPS.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

I always have one or two hobby projects that I work on to learn more. Most aren't public and I tend to abandon them after some time due to lack of interest.

My current projects are:

- [LifeCompile](http://lifecompile.com/) - A site to compile everything about you. (A diary on steroids)
- [Gardenrr](http://gardenrr.com/) - A helpful gardening app for Android.

<h2>The Site</h2>

<p>
The site is generated using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a>, I highly recommend it.
