title: My Fascination With Developer Workstations
---

For as long as I remember I’ve been fascinated by the different configurations, gear and setting of developer workstations. Unfortunately it can cause your wallet to shrink, but at the same time it can give you better ideas for your own home office.

Here are a few memorable workstations that come to my mind:

### <a href="http://www.stefandidak.com/office/">Stefan Didak’s Home Office</a> ###

Stefan’s office boasts an incredible array of monitors, machines and a mighty bookshelf. He goes into a good amount of detail as to what everything does and why he needs it. Definitely worth checking out his site.


Stefan Didak's main desk. Too much? I don't think so...

### <a href="http://www.biscade.com/">Mitch Haile’s office</a> ###

Mitch’s office is a programmer’s oasis tucked into an attic nearby in Boston. Click on the link above or the image below and follow his attic transformation!

### <a href="http://web.mit.edu/zacka/www/">Zack Anderson’s MIT Dorm Room</a> ###

I followed Zack’s website quite a bit during my college days at Wentworth. He went to MIT and had several fun, controversial and hilarious projects posted on his site over the years. I’d highly recommend checking out his automated dorm room as well, the video is posted below. Not quite a workstation, but also worth checking out.

MIT Dorm at it's finest

###And then there’s mine ###

Not quite as large or extensive as the workstations above, but it perfectly fits my needs at home. It’s evolved quite a bit as I’ve moved from home, to various dorms at college and finally to my first apartment.

So much work area!


3 24" screens. The worlds best keyboard and a 19" for email/winamp etc.

With the prices of LED/LCD displays dropping, I managed to pick up two new 24″ displays for my workstation. I already was rocking 24″ and 21″ displays, but I really wanted something “uniform.” A few months back I picked up the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for both work and home. My hands have been in love ever since (no more occasional aching!).

I leave you with one final workstation you may have seen on the big screen…
