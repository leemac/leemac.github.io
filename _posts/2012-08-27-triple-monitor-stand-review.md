title: Triple Monitor Stand Review
---

**Disclaimer** I am in no way associated with [http://shop.easymountlcd.com/](http://shop.easymountlcd.com/). The following post is my own experience with them. I also am not a professional reviewer, so persue your own purchase/setup at your own risk.

### Background

A few months ago I upgraded my home workstation with the addition of two new LCD screens. Having three monitor has greatly improved my productivity at home as well as at the office. The problem I found was that the stands took up quite a bit of space. Not only that, but using books to prop up the screens to the optimal hieight is tacky and still doesn't fix the desk space problem.

This is what I had for a while. It worked, but I really wanted to be able to adjust all the monitors.

### Finally a Decent Product

For quite a while I scoured the net for a mount that was cheap but very durable. Most seemed cheap or too expensive to really justify. Finally, I came across a [really nice looking mount](http://shop.easymountlcd.com/Deluxe-Triple-Monitor-Stand-Desktop-Clamp-up-to-28-002-0019-002-0019.htm) from [http://shop.easymountlcd.com/](http://shop.easymountlcd.com/). Having found some photos from people who purchased the mount, it appeared to be solid and at ~$76.95 it was a bargain, so why not?

After sending the package to the wrong work address, they quickly fixed the shipping and I recieved it a few days later. Since the site is small, of course there is reason to worry about who is behind the company. Luckily I recieved a call from a nice guy working there, he suggested sending it to a local FedEx for pickup.

### Unboxing &amp; Setup

What I got was this 45 lb. box.

Inside the box was a neatly packed assortment of nuts, steel and plastic.

One thing I noticed immediatly was the weight and thickness of the center pole. It is very heavy steel and built very well all around.

There is also a nice hold in the bottom for the wiring to neatly exit to the back of your workstation.

The clamp will have no problem with just about any size desk.

Setting the rest of it up was pretty easy and straightforward.

Wiring is easy to tuck away. I found some velcro straps for a few bucks that helped out tie the wires to the arms.

The final result is exactly what I was hoping for. A clean, minimal, clutter-free desk to do my work. I have ample amounts of room to move my mouse. My laptop can also be opened without blocking any of the desktop screens.

### Final Verdict

It has been a few months now since I got this mount. So far, no problems at all. Like I said, it's very sturdy and made of well build parts. My desk is cleaner than ever and I can finally get the LCD's at a height that is ideal without being tacky and placing them on thick books from school.

If you're looking for an LCD mount like this, I'd suggest taking a look at these guys. My only suggestion is make sure your desk is sturdy enough (no glass!!!) to handly the weight of all your LCD's and the mount at one center point.
