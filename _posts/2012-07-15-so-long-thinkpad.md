title: So Long Thinkpad - Hello Sony Vaio
---

### The Bad ###

About a week ago my Thinkpad died. It’s gone to a better place and I did everything I could to revive it. It was an awesome machine. Tough, durable and fast. Before it died, it would overheat easily, shutdown randomly and the battery/charger started giving me problems.

Over the past few weeks I gave it a prognosis of onset motherboard failure. Simple put, the board died. Replacement “may” possible, but the screen is fading away, keyboard is showing it’s age and the specs are 4 years old…it’s time for a new machine.

I scoured the net for laptop reviews, it is the first time I’m actually buying a laptop. My Thinkpad was part of my tuition at school so finding  a new machine was new to me.

### The Search ###

My options included [Ultrabooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook), with their sleek aluminum and soldered on parts ([MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/), [the new Dell XPS](http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/xps-laptops?c=us&l=en&cs=19), [Sony Vaio Z](http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&identifier=S_Z_SERIES_PAGE)), these all look awesome but you are stuck if the battery dies or want to pop in more memory. Ultrabooks are great for your parents/family, but for us hackers and engineers, they don’t make sense.

There are also [insane gaming machines](http://www.alienware.com/Landings/laptops.aspx) with god-like powers, bible-thick casings and enough neon lights to put Vegas to shame. I don’t game often, when I do it’s on my desktop. I may play the new Guild Wars 2 on this new machine, but I won’t need or expect insane graphics. I need this for development, surfing/research, movies, work, etc. etc..

I ended up in the middle of the road with the [“normal” Sony Vaio S](http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&identifier=S_SB_SERIES_PAGE).

### The Machine ###

The machine will be built in the next few days, then probably shipped from Asia given the “estimated arrival date,” [let’s hope it’s cargo container doesn’t go overboard.](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=overboard+cargo+container&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1920&bih=936&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=Amj2T6eKEaOO6AHuh7XzBg)

Once it arrives I’ll be [installing a zippy SSD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148442) (or two in RAID 0, who needs a DVD drive these days?). I could have gotten the dual SSD’s in raid 0 from Sony, but for $250 extra? Hell no, I’ll do that myself thank you! There is a good online community at [notebookreview.com](http://forum.notebookreview.com/sony-owners-lounge-forum/669429-official-2012-sony-s-series-owners-thread-178.html) which was helpful in making my decision. I wanted to make sure I could access the guts.

### The Specs ###

The following are the specs of the machine. With the exception of the graphics, it will actually be more powerful than my desktop which is almost 5 years old…

- 3rd gen Intel® Core™ i7-3612QM quad-core processor
- NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 640M LE (2GB) hybrid graphics with Intel® Wireless Display technology
- 15 1/2" LED backlit Full HD display (1920 x 1080)
- 8GB (4GB fixed onboard with 4GB removable) DDR3-1333MHz
- 640GB (7200rpm) hard drive [(To be replaced with a 128GB SSD)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148442)

I will probably post a quick review with plenty of photos once it arrives later this month!
