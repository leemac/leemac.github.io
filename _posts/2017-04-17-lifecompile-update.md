title: Life Compile Update
---

Quick update on [LifeCompile](https://github.com/leemac/lifecompile) which I've started hacking on again lately.

I'm beginning to develop the platform with [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core). I've listed quite a few cool features this could have on the repo's readme, so take a look.

The architecture will be an ASP.NET Core backend with a React front-end. I think the combination of the two is just too good to pass up and is on the bleeding edge of the best technologies out there, plus I love C# and all the cool stuff Microsoft is doing these days. It also gives me a good chance to learn more about ASP.NET Core outside of my work day and continue to enjoy ReactJS.

My first step however is to build a good foundation to build this upon. The system should be extendable by any type of programming language, platform and host system. A good API will facilitate this as the data coming in could be very cool to visualize, aggregate and report off of.

Until next time.
