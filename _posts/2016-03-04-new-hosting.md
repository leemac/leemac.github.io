This site is now hosted on Github pages instead of my Linode Private server.

The reasoning is pretty simple, ease of updating and maintenance. Prior to Github pages, I'd host my site on a Linode VPS which requires me to maintain and update. Also, with Github pages, I can update my Jekyll-powered blog via the web interface and Github will automatically regenerate the site (very cool!).

Going forward, my blog will remain on Github pages, while my various hobby projects will reside on Linode. I may may move to DigitalOcean in the near future for these projects however, as most are private and aren't used beyond my private use.
