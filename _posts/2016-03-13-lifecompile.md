Over the past few years, I've noticed that as I get older, keeping track of memories, photos and events becomes harder. It's not so much that I forget things, but more that there is so much that goes on in life that those memories begin to fade. This problem has led me to over time wish I had a way to organize everything. From digital photos and videos to daily events, I've wanted to track it all.

I bet there are many others that also have this need. The app [https://gyrosco.pe/](https://gyrosco.pe/) has been making rounds over the past year or so. While it looks awesome, I want something that is open-source and is not linked to so many external services. I occasionally post on social media sites. Most photos/videos are taken privately and stored so. I want something that aggregates all this data locally where only I (or some family members) have access.

My new project is called [Life Compile](http://lifecompile.com). The project kicks off today with some planning and a basic feature list. Unfortuantely time is not on my side given my day job, but I look forward to hacking something together for fun this Spring.
