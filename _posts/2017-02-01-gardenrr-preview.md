title: Project Preview - Gardenrr Android App
---

I've been working on a small project called [Gardenrr.com](http://gardenrr.com) for the past 2 years or so on and off. Lately I've been getting back into it with Winter in full swing here in the Boston area.

Anyways, below are some screenshots of what I have thus far. I've gotten pretty far and I'm happy with the results so far. I'm hoping to throw this on the market soon with Spring around the corner. It connects to my server which hosts the app server (Django/Python).
