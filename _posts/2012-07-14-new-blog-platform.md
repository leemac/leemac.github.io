So long Wordpress! I've finally updated the blog to use Jekyll. Old posts will be moved over shortly!

### Why Jekyll? ###

I've moved to Jekyll for the following reasons:

### Maintainability ###

With Jekyll I have the ability to easily update and maintain the site from a structural standpoint. Since the site is now static HTML, there is no code-behind to deal with.

All I want from a blogging platform is the ability to write my thoughts and not have to worry about updating my Wordpress installation due to new PHP/Wordpress exploits.

### Look & Fee ###

Once again, because of the static state of the site and the fact that Jekyll uses [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) to aid with the frontend, I can easily change and update the structure of the site. No more moving PHP snippets around which hurt the readability of the template (to me at least).

### Publishing ###

My new workflow for writing posts is:

+ Write new post in Sublime Text 2
+ Commit the change to Github
+ Publish to FTP

At first glance, the fact that I have to commit to a Git repository may seem like a bit overkill for blogging. The fact is, it's really not that bad. I do save a few steps compared to Wordpress.

On my commute to work I have intermittent wireless internet access. I can fire up Jekyll in a shell, write a post and get it all ready for publishing later.

With wordpress, I need internet access (which I usually don't have) to visit the admin panel of Wordpress. Of course I could write something up and keep it in Sublime text and copy and paste later, but there's a disconnect there I don't trust. I've tried this approach but I typically fail to actually publish the post.

### Markdown & Something New ###

I've been wanting to learn Markdown for a while. Sites like Stackoverflow use this HTML conversion language for their questions and comments. It's not complex at all, but a markup language I've found to be useful all over the web.

Jekyll is different and it's something I've wanted for a while. I like how it converts raw files into a working static HTML site.

### Final Thoughts ###

Overall, I'm liking the system thus far. It's only been a few days but I like the simplicity of it all. Other developers I've noticed are using the system themselves as well and it's been catching on.

Don't get me wrong, but I do think Wordpress and other blogging platforms have thier place in the blogosphere. Non-technical folks will find them much easier to use, setup, update and configure. It's a matter of preference pretty much.

 Old pt's see how well the site holds up!
