title: RSS Reader Progress

### Background

During the Spring of this year I started working on an RSS reader and wrote a little post about it. With the shutdown of Google Reader, I wanted to create my own RSS app that I had full control over. Today I'm in the process of migrating an app I started in the Spring over to Python/Django with the hopes of finishing version 1.0 by Winter's end.

### Progress?

I haven't made much progress however. In the time since, I've purchased my first home, began planning a wedding (well <i>she</i> is!) and a full time job at a busy start-up, my side projects have side-lined as one might expect. As things settle down though, I'm finding some time and enthusiasm to finish this project.

### The Changes

The stack will be changing as I found Ruby/Rails much too "magical" and unpredictable. Coming from an explicit background in .NET, I like the rigidness of Python. After just a weekend I already have a basic RSS reader. I spent little time fighting component versions, strange errors and/or confusing documentation.

I also have a name for the project, JellyFish RSS.

### Future Plans

My plan over the next few weeks is to work on the UI, create the crawler job that will parse feeds and publish a basic demo app on this site. Once that is done, I can implement some of the features I've always wanted in an RSS app.
