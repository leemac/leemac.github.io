The following are projects I've been working on for fun. I rarely make anything public as my time is limited, but I often hack on something every winter while stuck inside.

## [Arkive](http://arkive.io)

### What is it? 

A modern twist to the family album. It's mostly in the planning stages so there's nothing to see yet.

### More details
I have thousands of photos to scan and I find Google Photos lacking. The goal here is to develop a self-hosted solution to archive family photos. The major features will be to make it very easy to share and tag (events, people, objects). This could also help collect photos from multiple family members, getting photos out of peoples shoe boxes, closets and phones.

### Technology
ASP.NET Core + React/Redux + TypeScript

## [Gardenrr](https://gardenrr.com)

### What is it?

A fully featured gardening app. Still in alpha/beta. 

### More details
I have a decent garden every year (nearly 9 large garden beds) and Gardenrr will help me do this more efficiently in the future. 

### Technology
React/TypeScript for the frontend. Django/Python/Postgres on the backend.
