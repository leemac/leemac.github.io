                <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Lee, a developer and technical leader with nearly 20 years of experience in the tech industry. But more importantly, I'm a proud dad to two amazing little boys who keep me on my toes every single day.</p>

                <p>My journey in tech has taken me through some interesting placesâ€”from building portfolio management systems for hedge funds and fund of funds, to developing data quality tools and systems that help fight financial crime. I've always been drawn to solving complex problems and building software that actually makes a difference.</p>

                <h2>The Developer Side</h2>
                <p>Over the years, I've worn many hats in the tech world:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Leadership:</strong> Building and leading engineering teams</li>
                    <li><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> End-to-end software solutions</li>
                    <li><strong>System Architecture:</strong> Designing scalable, maintainable systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Tackling complex business and technical challenges</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've worked with everything from financial systems that handle millions of dollars to data platforms that process terabytes of information. The common thread has always been a focus on quality, reliability, and creating value for users.</p>

                <h2>The Dad Side</h2>
                <p>But honestly? My most important and challenging job is being a dad. My two boys have taught me more about patience, creativity, and problem-solving than any codebase ever could. They've also shown me that debugging a tantrum is remarkably similar to debugging codeâ€”you need to understand the root cause, not just the symptoms.</p>

                <p>Balancing a career in tech with being present for my family has been an ongoing learning experience. Some days I nail it, other days I definitely don't. But that's what makes this journey worth documenting.</p>

                <h2>Why This Blog?</h2>
                <p>I started this blog to capture the intersection of these two worlds. The lessons I've learned in tech often apply to parenting, and vice versa. Whether it's managing technical debt or teaching a 4-year-old about consequences, there's always something to learn and share.</p>

                <p>Plus, after nearly 20 years in this industry, I've got some stories to tell and perspectives to share. I hope they're useful to someone else navigating similar waters.</p>

                <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
                <p>I'm always interested in discussing technology, leadership, or comparing notes on parenting over coffee (or in my case, probably over several coffees).</p>
