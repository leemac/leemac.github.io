        <h1>Lee McKinnon</h1>

        <p>Hi there.</p>
        <p>I'm an engineer at <a href="https://ledgex.com" target="_blank">Ledgex</a> where I've been building fantastic software for multi-asset allocators for the past decade. More recently, I commited the first bits of code that is now known as Ledgex Pro which provides better data insights + confidence for institutional investors.</p>
        <p>I primarily work with ASP.NET Core, React/Redux/TypeScript/ES6, C#, SQL and Azure. On the side, I hack on projects built upon django/python, React, TypeScript, as well as the C#. Aside from day-to-day development, I also enjoy contributing to our technical leadership team & culture, security efforts, product design and expansion of our platform.</p>
        <p>Within the business domain, I led development efforts to build out the engines that power our liquidity and tax lot tracking. I've also built out functionality to handle functionality around Private Equity, Partnerships, Unitized Funds and public Equities.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, my family keeps me busy with plenty of kayaking & outdoor adventures in the New England area, cooking great food, watching good movies, mountain biking and cruising around in my favorite <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3" target="_blank">electric car</a>. I also hack on side projects built upon django/python as well as the .NET ecosystem that never seem to reach the finish line ðŸ˜Š.</p>
        <p>You can also find me on the internet elsewhere:</p>
