I've migrated the React-based frontend for Gardenrr to TypeScript. This change comes as I have been becoming more acquainted with the added benefits of typing with JavaScript.

## Where I left off

- Mobile or no mobile?

## The Changes 

- Updating React to latest + npm modules to support TypeScript
- Adding interfaces for State/Props
- Adding interfaces for domain models
- Fixing many issues with typing added

...

## Going Forward

- Continue to keep npm modules up to date
- Adding tests
- Ignore Redux for now
- Removing clutter/features I don't care about
- Hyperfocused, aiming to release MVP by February
